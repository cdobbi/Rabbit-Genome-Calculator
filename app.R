# Attribution Statement: I used AI assistance to help write individual lines of R code, but I worked through each one carefully—asking questions. I renamed variables, studied the syntax, naming conventions, and control flow to ensure I understood the meaning of every word and the logic behind it. The overall concept, structure, and application to animal husbandry are entirely my own design. I may not be writing code fully on my own yet, but I hope this calculator represents what I’ve learned and how I’ve applied it.

# R is designed around vectorized operations, meaning functions or operations can be applied to an entire vector at once without needing a loop which makes R code very efficient for data analysis.
# R stores the input string in RAM as soon as you type it; substr() just reads that in-memory string—no extra file required.
# Syntax quick-reference:
# <-  : assignment operator (binds a value to a name).
# <<- : assignment reaching parent environments (not used, but common in R).
# =   : also assigns inside argument lists (same binding idea).
# ()  : call operator; wraps function arguments.
# {}  : code block (groups multiple statements).
# []  : indexing operator for vectors/data frames.
# %in%: set membership test.
# ==  : equality comparison.
# !=  : not-equal comparison.
# !   : logical NOT.
# &&  : single-value logical AND (short-circuits).
# ||  : single-value logical OR (short-circuits).
# #   : comment marker; everything to the end of the line is ignored.

# - Inputs: doe_genotype, buck_genotype (strings such as "Bb" or "EE")
# - Goal: return all possible child genotype combinations by mixing parents' alleles.
# - Alleles are the different versions of a gene carried on each chromosome copy
# - Genotype is the pair of alleles, 
# - Phenotype is the visible trait (like coat pattern) produced by that genotype.
